# Codecademy

This is some part of my work as I'm doing the Computer Science Career Path by Codecademy.

Due to the difference in variable names I separate files that were created by me and those that were provided by Codecademy.

## CS101: Introduction to Programming

I am trying to make a Text Adventure game for the final project. Here I make a simple scenario where user need to buy an ice cream. Each choice will lead to a different path.

## CS102: Data Structures and Algorithms

The file node.py is provided by Codecademy for this course.

### Node

Nodes are the building blocks of data structure.

Files:

* my_node.py

### Doubly Linked Lists

Doubly linked lists is similar to linked lists. However, the nodes have points for their previous and next node, whereas basic linked lists only have points for the next nodes.

Files:

* doubly_linked_lists.py

### Queues

Queues are data structure that contains an ordered set of data. For this structure we can use linked lists or doubly linked lists.

Files:

* queues.py

### Stacks

It is similar to queues. However, it uses the system FILO (First In, Last Out). Here we also have a small exercise to create a game called Tower of Hanoi that represent the use of stacks.

Files:

* my_stack.py - material about stack that I have done
* stack.py - a file by Codecademy for the Tower of Hanoi project
* tower_of_hanoi.py

### Hash Maps

An action where we turn strings into numerical number. Where if we look the numerical values up from an array we will be able to find the value.

Files:

* hash_maps.py
